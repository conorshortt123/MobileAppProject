- 	Commit 1: Registration section of the app finished, user can now log in/register and with the use of two way data binding,
	display the username at the top of the app. Username and password are saved using the local storage plugin.
-	Commit 2: Installed the "shake" plugin which will be later used to roll the dice. For now it simply alerts "shake!" to the phone screen
	when the accelerometer exceeds the default sensitivity of 40.
